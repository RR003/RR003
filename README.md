Software Engineer (Intern)
--------------------------

I have first dabbled in programming in high school and loved the problem-solving aspect of it, which ultimately led me to major in Computer Science in college. I then learned full-stack development and now have multiple personal projects, such as Stockfluence and ShowBinge. I have completed various Software Engineering internships, with my most recent one at Verisk Analytics
